# Assessment overview

During this module you will be investigating various intelligent systems, techniques
and algorithms that can be used to support various processes in Computer Games. For
this assessment you should choose two different Artificial Intelligence (AI)
techniques and use them to develop an application of your choosing in the Computer
Games domain.

# The Application
You should develop an application and use it to compare and contrast two different AI
systems. You should consider which game genre would be most appropriate to test the
AI algorithms that you have chosen. But, remember, whatever game genre you choose
you will have to have enough data to enable you to create a reasonably sophisticated
AI system.

Once you have chosen an appropriate genre for your application, then you will need
to choose two different AI techniques that should be used to solve a particular
problem in that genre.

Your application should be able to switch between the two AI techniques to show
how the application works with each one.

# Some Ideas

You have a completely free choice as to what your AI system will do, but here are
some possible ideas to get you started.

1. You could use an AI to make a racing car follow the racing line.

2. You could have a decision making system to create believable interactions
with game characters.

3. You could try a planning system to create strategies in a Real Time Strategy
(RTS) game.

4. You could try using AI techniques to automatically generate game content.

5. You could use evolutionary (or other) algorithms to ‘evolve’ opponents in
games in order to balance the challenge of the game to the skills of the player
(Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)).

6. You could use Affective Computing techniques to detect emotions in the
player, which will change the game play.

7. You could use emotional modelling to create ‘realistic’ behaviours in the
NPCs.

8. You could think of a specific issue that you have come across in games and
come up with an AI solution.

I’m sure you can think of many more examples. You will have the chance to discuss
your ideas and get feedback on them during week 7. You should discuss your idea
with me before you go ahead with the implementation to ensure that you are doing
something appropriate.

# The Report

Your report should describe fully the design process for the application, giving
specific details of the two AI techniques used. You should give full rationale for your
choice of AI techniques. I.e. why you chose them and why they are particularly suited
for your particular application. Your report should include details of testing the two
AI techniques, and explain what differences there were between them. You should
also compare the two techniques in terms of computational efficiency and ease of
coding.

# Grading the assessment

## The report (60% weighting)
Should be well written and structured in a style suitable for a technical report
(Introduction, method, test data, results and conclusions with appropriate headings
etc.). Any references used should be appropriately cited. There should be a full set of
test data and results as well as suitable conclusions drawn and discussion on the
advantages and disadvantages of each AI technique.

## The application (40% weighting)

The application should be coded efficiently and properly documented. You will need
to demo the application to me at a time to be arranged during the submission week.
